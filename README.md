Once Human SCP: Fusion Planner Tool

There is still a lot I need to clean up and add but the bones are here for a decent database and stepping stone to get someone started with fusing.  

If you would like to help with this I would greatly appreciate it. I haven't had a chance to go through each and every dataset fully so some items may be outdated, missing, or incorrect but I've been trying to gather as much information as I can from all over.

I've added in most of the features on my To-Do list so the design shouldn't change much but it may still look different day to day as I tweak the UI and whatnot

  
  

Features:  
-
**Arena Shop / Technique / Trait database**  
Basic searchable databases that I pull from throughout the tool

**Custom Build Planner**  
Plan your deviation by selecting which techniques and/or Traits you want it to have. Hit generate strategy to see what the best deviations to use to transfer over without transferring unwanted techniques

**Squad Builder**  
Store up to 3 different deviations so you can compare and plan your team (or use it to compare 3 versions of the same one)

**Share Code**  
Save your single deviation (or squad) to be able to come back to it later or to share your plan with someone else. Since everything is hosted locally the page wont keep your build on refresh

**Technique Isolation Checker**  
Instead of going through the planner you can singularly check a deviation's technique to find the best fusion partner to safely transfer a technique to

**Technique Search**  
Lookup a technique and it'll show all deviations that can have it

**Deviation Search**  
Organized deviations by their type with filters or search by name. Info card shows all learnable techniques and PSI / Passive Ability

**Deviation Compare Tool**  
Compare two deviations and see what techniques overlap

There is also a database checker that I mostly use for myself to keep track of what I'm missing (that I'm aware of)
